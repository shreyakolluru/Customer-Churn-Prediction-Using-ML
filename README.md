# Customer-Churn-Prediction-Using-ML
This project uses machine learning techniques to predict customer churn based on historical customer data. By analyzing behavior patterns, it helps businesses identify customers who are likely to leave, so they can take proactive steps to retain them.

📌 Project Overview
Customer churn is a critical metric for any subscription-based or service business. This project applies various supervised learning algorithms to predict whether a customer is likely to churn. The dataset is processed, visualized, and modeled using Python and popular machine learning libraries.
